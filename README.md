Capacitor and Resistor Optimization for NE555 IC LED Blinker Circuit

This project aims to optimize the capacitor and resistor values within an NE555 
IC LED blinker circuit for 1 Hz output frequency . By leveraging MATLAB for analysis and optimization, we seek to 
achieve a specific blink frequency while unraveling the constraints of component values and 
circuit behavior.
