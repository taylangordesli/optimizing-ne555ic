Capacitor and Resistor Optimization for NE555 IC LED Blinker Circuit

This project aims to delve into the optimization of capacitor and resistor values within an NE555 
IC LED blinker circuit. By leveraging MATLAB for analysis and optimization, we seek to 
achieve a specific blink frequency while unraveling the constraints of component values and 
circuit behavior.
